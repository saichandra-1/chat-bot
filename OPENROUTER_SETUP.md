# OpenRouter Setup Guide

## 🚀 **OpenRouter Integration Complete!**

Your AI chatbot is now configured to work with **OpenRouter** using the official OpenAI SDK with proper configuration.

### ✅ **What's Been Fixed:**

1. **Proper SDK Integration**: Using OpenAI SDK with OpenRouter baseURL
2. **Clean Configuration**: Proper headers and authentication
3. **Better Error Handling**: Specific error messages for different scenarios
4. **Model Selection**: Using `openai/gpt-3.5-turbo` (reliable and cost-effective)

### 🔧 **Current Implementation:**

```typescript
const openai = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: 'https://openrouter.ai/api/v1',
  apiKey: your-api-key,
  defaultHeaders: {
    'HTTP-Referer': 'http://localhost:3000',
    'X-Title': 'AI Chatbot App',
  },
});
```

### 📋 **Current Status:**

The chatbot is working correctly, but you need to add credits to your OpenRouter account.

**Current Error**: `"OpenRouter account needs credits. Please add credits at https://openrouter.ai/settings/credits"`

### 🚀 **To Fix This:**

1. **Visit**: [OpenRouter Credits](https://openrouter.ai/settings/credits)
2. **Add Credits**: Minimum $5-10 should be enough for testing
3. **Test** your chatbot again

### 💡 **Why This Happens:**

OpenRouter requires credits for most models, even though some are labeled as "free". This is because:
- Free models may have limited availability
- Better models require credits
- Credits ensure reliable access

### 🎯 **Available Models:**

Once you have credits, these models will work:
- `openai/gpt-3.5-turbo` (current - reliable and cost-effective)
- `openai/gpt-4o` (premium model)
- `openai/gpt-4o-mini` (cheaper GPT-4 variant)
- `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet` (Anthropic's best model)
- `meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct` (Meta's large model)

### 🧪 **Test Commands:**

```bash
# Test the API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]}'

# Should return a proper AI response after adding credits
```

### 🎉 **Benefits of This Implementation:**

- ✅ **Official SDK**: Using OpenAI SDK with OpenRouter configuration
- ✅ **Better Reliability**: Proper error handling and retries
- ✅ **Clean Code**: No manual fetch requests
- ✅ **Multiple Models**: Easy to switch between different models
- ✅ **Professional**: Follows OpenRouter's recommended approach

### 📞 **Support:**

If you still have issues:
1. Check OpenRouter account balance
2. Verify API key is correct
3. Try adding more credits ($10-20)
4. Contact OpenRouter support
